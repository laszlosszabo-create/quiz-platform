# Development Report — 2025-08-20

## Summary
- Stabilized the email automation pipeline across mixed schemas and flaky dev timing.
- Fixed missing-recipient cancellations by adding backfill + grace and delayed scheduling when recipient is unknown.
- Made automation rule queries compatible with both legacy and new schemas.
- Allowed automation to trigger even when the user email isn’t immediately known; backfill resolves it before send.
- Verified queue processing end-to-end; new items are now sent automatically.
- Restarted the dev server; addressed transient Next.js dev cache/hot-update issues.

## Root causes observed
- Schema drift: local env lacks `public.leads`; only `quiz_leads` exists (legacy). Code was initially querying `leads` only in some paths.
- Queue items with empty `recipient_email` were cancelled immediately by the cron.
- Automation rules table differs by env: some use `rule_type`, others `trigger_event`.
- Dev timing: lead capture and result generation race caused recipient to be unknown at enqueue-time.
- Next.js dev transient module-not-found and 404 for hot update/static chunks (dev cache volatility).

## Changes by file

- `src/app/api/cron/process-email-queue/route.ts`
  - Missing recipient handling: don’t cancel immediately. Reschedule (+2 min) within a grace window (default 2h via `EMAIL_RECIPIENT_GRACE_MS`). After grace, cancel with `missing_recipient_timeout`.
  - Added requeue for stale `processing` items (default 15m via `EMAIL_PROCESSING_STALE_MS`).
  - Kept post-render variable validation to avoid false positives.

- `src/lib/email-automation.ts`
  - Rule lookup: try new `trigger_event`, then fall back to legacy `rule_type` with the same filters; continue only with matching rules.
  - Enqueue: if recipient is unknown, add a small buffer (+5 min) to `scheduled_at` to allow lead backfill before processing.
  - Variables: added safe defaults (`unsubscribe_url`, `quiz_id`) and ensured URL variables are always present.
  - Kept robust recipient enrichment chain: session → leads via `lead_id` (if exists) → `quiz_leads` by session → recent `leads` → recent `quiz_leads`.

- `src/app/api/ai/generate-result/route.ts`
  - Do not skip automation when email is missing; proceed to enqueue and let backfill populate the recipient.
  - Kept quiz-lead lookups (session-first, then recent by quiz).

- Admin endpoints
  - `src/app/api/admin/email-queue/route.ts` (no behavioral changes today; used for inspection).
  - `src/app/api/admin/email-queue/backfill/route.ts` (aligned with cron backfill logic; used for manual ops if needed).

## Behavior changes (intended)
- New queue items created without a known recipient are scheduled slightly in the future and retried by cron until backfilled or grace expires.
- Stuck `processing` rows automatically requeued after a timeout.
- Automation rules are resolved regardless of whether the environment has `trigger_event` or legacy `rule_type`.

## Verification
- Lead API: confirmed fallback to `quiz_leads` works; session linkage and best-effort session email/name updates succeed.
- Trigger: called `/api/ai/generate-result` with `skip_ai_generation: true` to exercise score-only path. Automation triggered.
- Queue: inspected `/api/admin/email-queue` — new items show populated `recipient_email` after enrichment; statuses progressed to `processing` and `sent`.
- Cron: executed `/api/cron/process-email-queue` — logs show processed=1 sent=1 on latest run after changes.
- Dev server: restarted; transient Next dev hot-update/module chunk 404s cleared after reload; app serves pages again.

## Ops knobs
- `EMAIL_RECIPIENT_GRACE_MS` — default 2h; time window to reschedule missing-recipient items before cancel.
- `EMAIL_PROCESSING_STALE_MS` — default 15m; requeue threshold for stuck `processing` rows.

## Known limitations / follow-ups
- Historical failed queue items remain failed; they’re safe to ignore or requeue manually if needed.
- Next.js dev ESLint warnings in admin UI remain (not addressed today).
- Transient dev module-not-found for vendor-chunks may appear after big edits; resolved by full reload or restart (already done once today).

## Next steps
- Add a small admin “Requeue with backfill” action for cancelled items with `missing_recipient_timeout`.
- Wire analytics for opens/clicks when available from provider.
- Add a small end-to-end test that simulates delayed lead submission to assert backfill behavior.
